# RapptrTest

Thank you so much for the opportunity to present my skills. I have completed the project with the requests included in the project.

* For the API calls, I used URLSession for the chat network call, and decide to use Alamofire for the POST Login network call.

* I also implemented the Delegate Protocol to pass data and functions between clients and UIViewControllers.

I would apprecaite any feedback! Looking forward to hearing from you! ðŸ˜Š
